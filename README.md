# NOISA, Network of Intelligent Sonic Agents, offers a solution for enhancing the quality of performer’s engagement in musical interaction. NOISA project provides an intelligent system that acts to maintain and deepen the performers en- gagement by learning from the performer’s actions and behavioural patterns while playing NOISA instruments. It monitors the internal states of a performer ( e.g. motivation, affective states and reactiveness) and acts to maintain these states; if the performer loses individual motivation or interest, the system reacts by changing its physical control-behaviour of the interface in order to make the interaction interesting again.
